		<!--LIFE-->
		<h2>Childhood</h2>
		
		<p class = "paragraph">I was born on March 7, 1994. I have resided in Florissant Missouri my entire life. As a child I enjoyed watching movies and reading. I also started watching hockey at a young age and have been following the Blues ever since. I went to McCluer North Highschool. I have been a fan of computers and video games ever since I was born. </p>
		
		<h2>Major</h2>
		
		<p class = "paragraph">I chose the Major of Computer Science because I have always like working with computers. I was considering getting a degree in math sinc I also like Math but since CS combines both I realized I should try computer science and if I didnt like it I could always switch. I started CS classes in Spring of 2013 and have been continuing ever since. I like that with CS you can start with nothing and have a hopefully functioning program that you created.</p>
		
		<h2>Goals</h2>
		
		<p class = "paragraph">My goals as they stand right now are to graduate with a degree in CS and find a job. Other than that I would also like to save enough money to get an arpatment after school is over. I also would like to start reading more since I think it definitley makes life better. Finally I think one of my main goals is just to be happy. </p>
