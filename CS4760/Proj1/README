About
-----
This project is the implementation of a logging utility which logs custom error messages into a text file
using queues to create a log. The main.c file acts as a driver which calls the function logError() which
in turn calls the functions in loglib.c to build the log. Time was converted to nanoseconds by 
multiplying time in seconds by 1 billion. RCS was used for version control and previous 
versions can be found in the RCS folder.
